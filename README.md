## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
I've been writing code since 2014 and have spent every moment since trying to improve. My favorite languages are Python, Java, and Ruby, though I'm happy to work in just about any language. Lately, I've spent most of my free-time doing web development for my non-profit. I also run game servers and develop Minecraft mods for fun.

## Projects üèó

### [sebs-scholarship](https://github.com/sebs-scholarship)

This is the account for my non-profit organization and where the majority of my contributions have been lately. We are a 501(c)(3) charity and all work is volunteer. We have a few [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) websites that I developed and maintain, as well as a Ruby plugin to generate OpenGraph images for our blog posts. This project has helped me learn about PHP, Ruby, and web development.

**Built primarily in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.**

### [snowy-peak-systems](https://github.com/snowy-peak-systems)

This is the account for my sole-proprietor LLC "Snowy Peak Systems". In these repos I host a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website deployed using GitHub Pages. This website contains a contact form that uses a backend API that I developed using AWS API Gateway, SES, and a Lambda written in Python. The Lambda and other infrastructure is deployed automatically using [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) from a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI/CD pipeline.

**Built primarily in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.**

### [CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template)

A [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) Minecraft plugin template repo which allows other developers to fork the project and create new server mods using the existing project structure. I used this project to teach myself more about [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as a CI/CD pipeline.

**This project is written in Java/Groovy.**
