# PersonDocs for Levi Muniz 🤖

## About ℹ️
I've been writing code since 2014 and have spent every moment since trying to improve. My favorite languages are Java, Python, and C++, though I'm happy to work in just about any language. Lately, I've spent most of my free-time doing web development for my non-profit. I've also been running game servers and developing mods for fun.

## Projects 🏗

### [sebs-scholarship](https://github.com/sebs-scholarship)

This is my non-profit organization and where the majority of my contributions have been lately. We are a 501(c)(3) charity and all work is volunteer. We have a few [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) websites that I develop and maintain.

**We build our products primarily in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.**

### [github/super-linter](https://github.com/github/super-linter)

Developed by and maintained by GitHub, super-linter is a compilation of code-analysis tools to help find errors in code in a CI/CD pipeline. I use this tool in many of my repositories, so I make contributions here when able.

### [leviem1/plugin-template](https://github.com/leviem1/plugin-template)

This is a repository template that I created to help get setup to write a [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) Minecraft plugin. I used this project to learn more about [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as a CI/CD pipeline.

**This project is written in Java/Groovy.**
